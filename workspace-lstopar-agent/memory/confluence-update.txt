## Overview

OpenClaw agents can install and configure skills themselves inside their sandbox. You don't need terminal access — just tell your agent what to do via chat.

This page covers the general installation process and skill-specific setup instructions.

---

## General Installation Process

### 1. Search for the skill

Ask your agent:

[!info]
*"Search ClawHub for a [skill name] skill"*
The agent will search ClawHub and present available options.

### 2. Install the skill

Tell the agent which one to install:

[!info]
*"Install the [skill name] skill"*
The agent will install the skill definition (via ClawHub) and the required CLI tool (via npm or binary download) inside the sandbox.

### 3. Provide credentials

The agent will ask for any required credentials. Always send credentials in a **direct/private chat**, never in group channels.

### 4. Verify

Ask the agent to perform a simple operation to confirm the skill works.

The agent installs the `confluence` skill definition via ClawHub and the `confluence-cli` npm package.

### Credentials

You need:

- **Email**: Your Atlassian account email
- **API Token**: Generate at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

Send to the agent in a private chat:

[!info]
*"CONFLUENCE_EMAIL=you@company.com CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN=your-token-here"*

### Verification

[!info]
*"Read this Confluence page: https://edgetech-atlassian.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Tools/pages/..."*

## Skill: Jira

### What it does

View, create, update, and transition Jira issues. List sprints, search with JQL, manage assignments and comments.

### Installation

Tell your agent:

[!info]
*"Search ClawHub for a Jira skill and install it"*
The agent installs the `jira` skill definition via ClawHub and downloads the `jira-cli` binary from GitHub (Go binary, not an npm package).

### Credentials

You need:

- **Email**: Your Atlassian account email
- **API Token**: Same token as Confluence — generate at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

Send to the agent in a private chat:

[!info]
*"JIRA_EMAIL=you@company.com JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-token-here"*

[!note]
The `JIRA_API_TOKEN` environment variable must be available in every session. Ask the agent to add it to the sandbox env config, or configure it in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.env`.

### Verification

[!info]
*"Read the latest 10 Jira tasks"*

### What gets stored

- Skill definition: `/workspace/skills/jira/`
- CLI binary: `/workspace/.npm-global/bin/jira` (downloaded from GitHub releases)
- Config: `/workspace/.config/.jira/.config.yml`
- Credentials: via `JIRA_API_TOKEN` env variable (not stored in a file)

You need:

- **API Key**: Register for free at https://newsapi.ai/register , then find your key at https://newsapi.ai/dashboard

Send to the agent in a private chat:

[!info]
*"EVENT_REGISTRY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here"*

### Free Plan Limits

[!warning]
- Last **30 days of content only** (no archive access)
- Article search: **1 token** per page (max 100 articles/page)
- Event search: **5 tokens** per page (max 50 events/page) — use sparingly
- No commercial use on the free plan
- Monitor your usage at https://newsapi.ai/dashboard

### Verification

[!info]
*"List the latest 10 news headlines from EventRegistry"*

### Example Queries

- *"Search EventRegistry for news about artificial intelligence"*
- *"What are the trending topics in the news right now?"*
- *"Get top headlines from the last 24 hours"*

## Skill: Gmail (gog CLI Alternative)

   curl -o skills/gmail/src/gmail.ts https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lstopar/abc123/raw/gmail.ts
   cd skills/gmail && npm install && npx tsc
   ```

2. Set up OAuth credentials:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop app type)
   - Save credentials to `~/.config/gogcli/credentials.json`

3. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   gog auth add luka.stopar@gmail.com --remote --step 1 --services gmail,calendar

```bash
# List latest emails
node skills/gmail/dist/gmail.js list 10

## Sandbox Requirements

For skill installation to work, the sandbox needs:

- **Network access** — sandbox network must not be `"none"` in the OpenClaw config
- **npm available** — Node.js and npm must be present in the sandbox image (for npm-based CLIs)
- **PATH configured** — the install directory must be in PATH

### PATH Configuration

The agent installs tools to `/workspace/.npm-global/` which persists across container reboots. To make them available automatically, add to your OpenClaw config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):

```json
{
"agents": {
"defaults": {
"sandbox": {
"docker": {
"env": {
"JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-jira-api-token",
"PATH": "/workspace/.npm-global/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
}
}
}
}
}
}
```

## Persistence

Everything lives in `/workspace/` (bind-mounted to the host), so it survives container reboots and recreations:

- **Skill definitions**: `/workspace/skills/<skill-name>/`
- **CLI tools**: `/workspace/.npm-global/`
- **Credentials**: tool-specific config files in the workspace

## Security Notes

- Always send credentials in a **private/direct chat**, never in group channels
- The agent stores credentials only in tool-specific config files, not in memory or log files
