assistant: 📬 Email Triage Agent – Authentication Required

❌ **Error**: Microsoft 365 authentication failed. The agent has been unable to process emails since **February 16th, 2026, 22:10**.

**Action Required**:
1. Run the following command in the OpenClaw workspace to re-authorize Microsoft 365 access:
   ```bash
   npm run auth
   ```
2. Retry the Email Triage Agent after authorization is complete.

**Next Scheduled Run**: 2026-02-18 14:00 (Europe/Ljubljana)
#openclaw #email
user: System: [2026-02-18 11:01:00 GMT+1] Cron: ### **Analysis of Email Triage Agent Execution**

The **Email Triage Agent** has encountered **recurring authentication issues** with the Microsoft 365 integration. Here’s a breakdown of the recent executions and the current status:

---

#### **1. Authentication Failures**
- **Last Successful Execution**: **February 16th, 2026, 22:10** (CET).
  - Processed **3 emails**: 1 draft created, 2 archived.
  - Summary posted to Telegram: [View Here](https://t.me/c/8403014547/761/893).
- **Subsequent Failures**:
  - **February 17th, 2026, 08:00**: Authentication failed. No emails processed.
  - **February 17th, 2026, 11:00**: Authentication failed. No emails processed.
  - **February 17th, 2026, 14:00**: Authentication failed. No emails processed.
  - **February 17th, 2026, 20:00**: Authentication failed. No emails processed.
  - **February 17th, 2026, 22:00**: Authentication failed. No emails processed.
  - **February 18th, 2026, 08:00**: No new emails to process (authentication likely still invalid).

---

#### **2. Root Cause**
- The **Microsoft 365 access token has expired or is invalid**.
- The agent cannot fetch or process emails without re-authorization.

---

#### **3. Action Taken**
- A summary of the authentication issue was posted to the `#comm @all` Telegram topic (ID: `761`) during each failed execution. Example:
  - [View Latest Summary](https://t.me/c/8403014547/761/998).

---

#### **4. Required Fix**
To restore functionality, **re-authorize the Microsoft 365 integration** by running the following command in the **OpenClaw workspace**:
```bash
npm run auth
```

---

#### **5. Next Steps**
1. **Re-authorize Microsoft 365 access** using the command above.
2. **Retry the Email Triage Agent** after authorization is complete.
3. The agent will automatically resume processing emails in the next scheduled run (today at **14:00 CET**).

assistant: MS365 auth is working fine from the main session. The triage agent's isolated sessions might be using a stale token. No action needed on your end — the auth issue appears to be specific to the cron agent's session, not the actual credentials.

New unread email since last check: **"How does OpenRouter pricing work?"** from OpenRouter Team (last night 23:25).
