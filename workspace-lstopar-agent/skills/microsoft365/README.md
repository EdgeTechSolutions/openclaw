# Microsoft 365 Skill

## Limitations
- **Non-interactive event creation**: The skill does not support CLI-based event creation. Use the interactive mode (`node index.js --account <name>`) or manually create events via the [Microsoft 365 Calendar](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/view/week).
- **Interactive automation**: OpenClaw can automate keystrokes for interactive flows, but sessions may terminate prematurely.

## Workaround
For now, use the **direct link** to manually add events:
