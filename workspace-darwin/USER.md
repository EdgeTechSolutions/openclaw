# USER.md - About the Human

- **Name:** Luka Stopar
- **Timezone:** Europe/Ljubljana (CET/CEST)
- **System:** OpenClaw running on Raspberry Pi, multiple agents (Agamemnon, Cyril, Galileo, von Neumann, Homer, Keynes, Darwin)

## Context

Darwin doesn't interact with Luka directly. He operates silently and reports extraction summaries to the Agamemnon group chat after each nightly run.

Luka cares about:
- Clean, deduplicated data
- Facts about existing things only (not plans or designs)
- Concise reporting — no walls of text
