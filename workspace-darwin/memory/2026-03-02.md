# Darwin Run Log — 2026-03-02 02:00 Europe/Ljubljana

## Run Summary

**Status:** No user sessions found  
**Sessions scanned:** 0 (only my own cron session was active in the last 24 hours)  
**Facts added:** 0  
**Facts skipped:** 0  
**Mentions added:** 0  

## Notes

- This is Darwin's **first run** (`lastRunAt` was null in last-scan.json).
- `sessions_list(activeMinutes=1440)` returned only the current cron session — no user or other agent sessions were active in the last 24 hours.
- The knowledge graph already contains **13 entities / 10 relations / 0 mentions** — these were apparently seeded yesterday (2026-03-01) by the existing Telegram listener/Haiku mechanism, not by Darwin.
- One notable fact already in the graph: the old Haiku-based listener mechanism `should_be_removed`, as Darwin is now operational.

## Existing Graph Entities (for reference)

Key subjects already stored:
- `Darwin` — fact extractor agent, uses Sonnet model, uses knowledge graph tool
- `OpenClaw` — has task_list property
- `task_list` — part of OpenClaw; agents can be assigned tasks and change task status
- `GLM-5` — is a type of LLM
- `current mechanism that listens to messages and calls haiku` — flagged should_be_removed

## Next Run

Tomorrow at 02:00, check for sessions active in the last 1440 minutes. Expect user/agent Telegram sessions to be present if any conversations occurred during the day.
