Here's the summary:\n\n**5 critical issues, 11 warnings** found across the OpenClaw installation.\n\n**Critical highlights:**\n- 🔴 **Disk at 85%** (2.1 GB free) — needs immediate cleanup. lobster/ (45 MB) + skill node_modules (~100 MB) are the biggest targets\n- 🔴 **Nightly Gmail Triage silently discards ~173K tokens/night** — delivery is set to `none`, so all that work goes nowhere\n- 🔴 **Two research jobs collide every Thursday at 17:00** — stagger by one hour\n- 🔴 **\"cron announce delivery failed\"** across 5 jobs = gateway WS timeout cascade from heavy concurrent runs on Pi\n\n**Top cost finding:** Email Triage alone = ~3.36M tokens/week (Opus+thinking × 4/day). Switching to Sonnet without thinking would save ~2.35M tokens/week.\n\n**Top 3 action items:**\n1. `rm ~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json.*.tmp` + prune unused skill node_modules to recover disk space\n2. Fix job `8d36ec52` (Gmail Triage) delivery → `announce` so results surface\n3. Move Context Engineering cron from `0 17 * * 4` → `0 18 * * 4` to avoid collision\n\nFull report posted to Telegram topic 615 in 5 messages (IDs 2826–2830).

Here's the executive summary:\n\n**Since the 22:01 Fri run — 3 fixes confirmed:**\n- ✅ Thursday research job collision resolved (19:00 stagger)\n- ✅ Email Triage staggered to :15\n- ✅ All 12 stale cron tmp files cleaned\n\n**3 critical issues this run:**\n\n1. 🔴 **workspace-lstopar-agent: 374MB → 525MB in 5 hours** — `.cache/uv/` (80 MB UV Python cache) appeared during this window. Fix: `rm -rf ~/.openclaw/workspace-lstopar-agent/.cache/uv/`\n\n2. 🔴 **Weekly Trading Portfolio failed delivery 2 consecutive Fridays** — the analysis completes (111K tokens spent) but \"cron announce delivery failed\" means the user never receives the report. Needs `bestEffort: true` delivery + write-to-file fallback.\n\n3. 🔴 **LLM Research Scan** — 1 consecutive delivery failure + historical model-mismatch errors still unresolved.\n\n**7 warnings remain unresolved** from the previous run (Homer missing files, von-neumann IDENTITY.md, BOOTSTRAP.md stubs, keynes shared/ root-owned, overpermissive sandbox tools, Opus+thinking on Email Triage).\n\nReport posted to Telegram topic 615 (messages 2923–2925).
