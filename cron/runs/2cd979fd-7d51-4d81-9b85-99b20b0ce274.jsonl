Here's the summary:\n\n**5 critical issues, 11 warnings** found across the OpenClaw installation.\n\n**Critical highlights:**\n- 🔴 **Disk at 85%** (2.1 GB free) — needs immediate cleanup. lobster/ (45 MB) + skill node_modules (~100 MB) are the biggest targets\n- 🔴 **Nightly Gmail Triage silently discards ~173K tokens/night** — delivery is set to `none`, so all that work goes nowhere\n- 🔴 **Two research jobs collide every Thursday at 17:00** — stagger by one hour\n- 🔴 **\"cron announce delivery failed\"** across 5 jobs = gateway WS timeout cascade from heavy concurrent runs on Pi\n\n**Top cost finding:** Email Triage alone = ~3.36M tokens/week (Opus+thinking × 4/day). Switching to Sonnet without thinking would save ~2.35M tokens/week.\n\n**Top 3 action items:**\n1. `rm ~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json.*.tmp` + prune unused skill node_modules to recover disk space\n2. Fix job `8d36ec52` (Gmail Triage) delivery → `announce` so results surface\n3. Move Context Engineering cron from `0 17 * * 4` → `0 18 * * 4` to avoid collision\n\nFull report posted to Telegram topic 615 in 5 messages (IDs 2826–2830).
